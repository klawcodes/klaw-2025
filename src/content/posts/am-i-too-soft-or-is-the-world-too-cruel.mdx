Life hits different when you're caught between wanting to stay vulnerable and protect yourself from the harsh realities that keep trying to break you down. Sometimes I wonder if my softness is a weakness or a strength - like, am I too sensitive or is the world just designed to crush anyone who dares to feel deeply? <br/><br/> There are moments when the cynicism around me feels suffocating, and all those beautiful dreams we once believed in seem to fade like watercolor memories, leaving behind only the cold edges of reality. Every disappointment chips away a little piece of hope, and I find myself questioning whether being kind is actually a superpower or just an invitation for people to walk all over you. Growing up means learning that not everyone has good intentions, and sometimes protecting your heart means building walls that you never thought you'd need.
