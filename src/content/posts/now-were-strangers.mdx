It's strange how memory works. I still know exactly how many steps it takes to reach your doorstep, how I can recite your number in my sleep, and how every street still reminds me of you yet here we are, complete strangers. All those expensive gifts I gave you, trying to keep your love, trying to make you stay faithful to us, but I guess some hearts just can't be bought. <br/><br/>

The worst part isn't seeing you glow up and thrive without me (though that cuts deep), it's watching you become someone I don't recognize anymore. You're out there now, going from one person to another, joining those early morning runs at dawn. I'm here, smiling for the cameras but dying inside, watching you become this new person I can only observe from a distance someone who seems happier without the love I tried so hard to give. <br/><br/>

They say time heals all wounds, but they never tell you what to do when you have to let someone go, knowing they'll become a different person someone who might be better off without you, even if it breaks your heart to admit it.
